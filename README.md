# Convex Optimization: Hybrid Steepest Descent method
This is a short summary of the paper: "A hybrid steepest descent method for constrained convex optimization".
Link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.automatica.2008.08.018
A short explanation of the paper is given as a report and a matlab code to realize the results presented in the paper.
This paper is comes under the umbrella of Convex Optimization methods. The steepest descent technique described can be compared to gradient descent algorithm popularly used in Machine Learning paradigm.
